\chapter{A Tutorial Introduction}
\section{Introdcution to \LaTeX \ }
\subsection{What is \LaTeX \ }
First let's begin with the pronunciation. \LaTeX \ is pronounced Lay-tek or Lah-tek and not Lay-teks. 
That is something that I got wrong when I first crossed paths with \LaTeX \ and I am making sure you won't.
\newline 
Now that we know how to pronounce the name corrently let's dive into what is \LaTeX. Well, \LaTeX \ is a software tool 
for creating documents. The user writes code in plain text. The code is later processed to genereate a 
a document with all the visual aspects taken care of. \LaTeX, unlike other word processing tools let's the user focus on the content and leave the visual asspects of the document to the software engine. 
\newline 
There are two ways to use \LaTeX, one is to downlaod packages onto your computer, and the second is to use a cloud based editor.
I use the \href{https://tug.org/texlive/}{TEX Live} Distrobution on Linux. Mac Users can use
\href{https://www.tug.org/mactex/}{MacTEX}. It is important to note that this method could require additional tweeking to get it to work properly.
\newline
Another good way to create documents with \LaTeX \ is by using a cloud based editor. 
\href{https://www.overleaf.com}{Overleaf} is a robust enough editor for students and small projects.
Ther are many great resources to learn \LaTeX \ online. 
\newline 
Regardless of which environment you choose for using \LaTeX \ you will work with two windows. 
One window is used for typing commands and content, and another window for viewing the porcessed output document.
\LaTeX \ can generates different types of output but the most used one is PDF (Portable Document Format) files. 
This is mainly becuse PDF is readable on every platform. Mobile and otherwise.\\
\subsection{A Commands In \LaTeX \ }
\LaTeX \ typesetting is made by using command that provide a an abondance of ways to format the document. 
Command are words that encapsulate certain behavior. Usually these words are perceded by a backslash '\' character. A command may take a parameter. 
New commands can be defines for special needs if standard commands do not sufice.

\subsection{Document Structure}
A \LaTeX \ source code file has two basic parts. The first part is called the Preamble and the second part is 
called the Document Environment.\\
\textbf{Preamble}\\
The preamble contains commnands that establish the basic parameters of the document.
The first line of a \LaTeX \ document is the documentclass command. 
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[latex]tex}]
\documentclass{article}
\end{lstlisting}
This command tells the \LaTeX \ compiler what type of document you are making, and that will make it load ceratain features.
After the documentclass command we can declare the packages we want you to use by calling the command usepackage.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[latex]tex}]
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\end{lstlisting}
Packages are files that contain more commands that can add to \LaTeX \ fucntionilaty. In this book We will cover the 
most important packages. 
\textbf{Document Environment}\\
cument is the document environment. An environment in \LaTeX \ is a block which will be processed aaccording to specific rules.\\ 
The document environment is the outermost container that will hold the
document. The environment block is denoted by two delimiters.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[LaTeX]TeX}]
\begin{document}
%document content goes here
\end{document{
\end{lstlisting}
Inside the document delimiters 
The most basic document in \LaTeX \ will look like this.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[LaTeX]TeX}]
\documentclass{article}
%preamble contonet goes here
\begin{document}
%document content goes here
\end{document{
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Compiling \LaTeX \ code}
\subsection{Compiling on a Linux machine}
To compile on a Linux machine you need to install the necessary packages.
On a Debian based distrobution.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
sudo apt-get install texlive-full 
\end{lstlisting}
On a Fedora based distrobution. use one of the following packages.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-basic
sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-medium
sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-full
\end{lstlisting}
\newpage
\subsection{Known issues}
\LaTeX \ requires double compilation for ceratin information to be properly embeded in the document.
Usually this is first noticed when trying to create a talbe of contents command
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[LaTeX]TeX}]
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\tableofcontents
\chapter{Chapter 1}

\section{Section 1}

this could be confusing for newcomers to \LaTeX \ but now you know.

The hyperref pakcage is used for creating links in the document as well as links 
for sites out of the document. Such as links to websites or other apps.

\subsection{Margins}
\LaTeX \ uses a 1.85in margin by default. This is considered a large margin by most poeple.\\ 
To change the margin we can use the geometry package.
\begin{lstlisting}[language={[LaTeX]TEX}]
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[margin=1.25in]{geometry}
\begin{document}
The margin now is better :)

How to insert a code block into a \LaTeX \ document?
\newline One way to emed code in the \LaTeX  file is by using a verbatim 
block. Verbatim blocks will embed the text as it 
appeard in the block
\newline For exmaple:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
Text in the verbatim block not processed as latex code.
\begin{verbatim}
\end{verbatim}
Another way is to use lstlisting block
The lstlisting is part of the listings package.
For more documentation about the listings package goto this \href{https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/latex/contrib/listings/listings.pdf}{link}
\newline For example:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
if __name__=="__main__":
    print("hello, world!")
\end{lstlisting}
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Using GNU make}
The GNU make tool is widly used to create \LaTeX \ documents since it is very suited for such a task. 
example code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=make]

OUTDIR = $(shell pwd)
TEX = pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode -file-line-error
PDFOUT = how_to_latex 
PDF_TARGET = $(addsuffix .pdf, $(PDFOUT)) 
LATEXIN = main.tex

all: pdf

pdf: $(PDF_TARGET)

$(PDF_TARGET): $(LATEXIN)
	$(TEX) -output-directory=$(OUTDIR) -jobname=$(PDFOUT) $(LATEXIN)
	$(TEX) -output-directory=$(OUTDIR) -jobname=$(PDFOUT) $(LATEXIN)
	echo "cleaning .aux and .log"
    rm -f $(addsuffix .log, $(PDFOUT)) $(addsuffix .aux, $(PDFOUT)) $(addsuffix-
    .out, $(PDFOUT)) $(addsuffix .toc, $(PDFOUT))
    echo "coping to web server"
	sudo cp $(PDF_TARGET) /var/www/html/pdf/
	echo -e "\033[0;32m Target Made Successfully \033[0m"

delete web:
	sudo rm /var/www/html/pdf/$(PDF_TARGET)
	
clean:
	rm  -f *.pdf *.aux *.dvi *.log *.toc
\end{lstlisting}
\end{document}
