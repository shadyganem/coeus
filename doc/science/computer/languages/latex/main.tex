How to insert a code block into a latex document?
\newline One way to emed code in the \LaTeX file is by using a verbatim 
block. Verabatim blocks will embed the text as it 
appeard in the block 
For exmaple:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
Text in the verbatim block not processed as latex code.
\begin{verbatim}
\end{verbatim}
Another way could be to open a lstlisiting block
For example:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
if __name__=="__main__":
    print("hello, world!")
\end{lstlisting}
\end{verbatim}
\end{document}
